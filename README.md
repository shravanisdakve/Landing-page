SkyLine - Landing Page
Task 1: Create a Responsive Landing Page
This project involves building a responsive landing page for the SkyLine brand as part of the first task in the web development course. The landing page is designed to showcase the brand, describe the services, and allow users to get in touch via a contact form. It is fully responsive, meaning it will look great on all devices, from desktop to mobile.

Project Overview
The landing page consists of the following main sections:
Header with Navigation: Fixed header containing the SkyLine logo and navigation links to different sections on the page (Home, About, Services, Contact).
Hero Section: A large, visually appealing section that introduces SkyLine, along with a brief message and a call-to-action button (Get Started).
About Section: A brief description of the SkyLine brand and its focus on delivering user-friendly, elegant, and responsive web designs.
Services Section: Highlights the services provided by SkyLine (Web Design, Development, and Branding), with each service presented in a visually distinct box.
Contact Section:Includes a form where users can enter their name, email, and message. It also contains links to the company's social media profiles (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn).
Footer:Contains copyright information and social media links.

Features
Responsive Design:The layout adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones.
Smooth Scrolling:The page supports smooth scrolling when navigating between sections.
Interactive Contact Form:The contact form allows users to submit inquiries directly from the landing page.
Social Media Links:Direct links to the company's social media profiles, such as Twitter, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

Technologies Used
HTML5 for the structure of the page.
CSS3 for styling, including media queries for responsiveness.

Future Enhancements
